The “Mini-Games Collection” is a Python program that offers users various engaging mini-games to play. The program has a menu with three games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Shuffle Ball, and Choose the Right Number.
Upon launching the program, users are greeted with a stylish welcome screen displaying the available game options. They can then enter their desired game choice using numeric input. The program gracefully handles any unexpected user input, guiding users to try again in case of errors.
The individual mini-games are designed to provide hours of entertainment and challenge for players. The Tic-Tac-Toe game tests strategic thinking and decision-making skills, while Shuffle Ball is a fun memory and coordination game.
